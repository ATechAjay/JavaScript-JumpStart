JavaScript textContent
how to use the JavaScript textContent property to get the text content of a node and its descendants.

Reading textContent from a node

To get the text content of a node and its descendants, you use the textContent property:

let text = node.textContent;
Suppose that you have the following HTML snippet:

<div id="note">
    JavaScript textContent Demo!
    <span style="display:none">Hidden Text!</span>
    <!-- my comment -->
</div>
The following example uses the textContent property to get the text of the <div> element:

let note = document.getElementById('note');
console.log(note.textContent);
Output:

JavaScript textContent Demo!
Hidden Text!
textContent vs. innerText

On the other hand, the innerText takes the CSS style into account and returns only human-readable text. For example:

let note = document.getElementById('note');
console.log(note.innerText);
Code language: JavaScript (javascript)

Output:

JavaScript textContent Demo!
As you can see, the hidden text and comments are not returned.

Since the innerText property uses the up-to-date CSS to compute the text, accessing it will trigger a reflow, which is computationally expensive.
Setting textContent for a node
Besides reading textContent , you can also use the textContent property to set the text for a node:
node.textContent = newText;
When you set textContent on a node, all the nodeâ€™s children will be removed and replaced by a single text node with the newText value. For example: let note = document .getElementById( 'note' ); note.textContent = 'This is a note' ; Code language: JavaScript ( javascript ) Summary Use the textContent property to return the concatenation of the textContent of every child node. You can use it to set a text for a node. The innerText returns the human-readable text that takes CSS into account.
