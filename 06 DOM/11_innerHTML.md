JavaScript innerHTML
how to use the JavaScript innerHTML property of an element to get or set an HTML markup contained in the element.
The innerHTML is a property of the Element that allows you to get or set the HTML markup contained within the element: element.innerHTML = 'new content' ; element.innerHTML;
Reading the innerHTML property of an element
To get the HTML markup contained within an element, you use the following syntax: let content = element.innerHTML;
When you read the innerHTML of an element, the web browser has to serialize the HTML fragment of the elementâ€™s descendants.
Simple JavaScript innerH
TML example
Suppose that you have the following markup: < ul id = "menu" > < li > Home </ li > < li > Services </ li > </ ul >
The following example uses the innerHTML property to get the content of the <ul> element:
let menu = document .getElementById( 'menu' ); console .log(menu.innerHTML);
Output: < li > Home </ li > < li > Services </ li >
Examining the current HTML source The innerHTML property returns the current HTML source of the document, including all changes that have been made since the page was loaded.
See the following example: <!DOCTYPE html > < html > < head > < meta charset = "utf-8" > < title > JavaScript innerHTML </ title > </ head > < body > < ul id = "menu" > < li > Home </ li > < li > Services </ li > </ ul > < script > let menu = document .getElementById( 'menu' ); // create new li element let li = document .createElement( 'li' ); li.textContent = 'About Us' ; // add it to the ul element menu.appendChild(li); console .log(menu.innerHTML); </ script > </ body > </ html > Code language: HTML, XML ( xml ) Output:
< li > Home </ li > < li > Services </ li > < li > About Us </ li >
Setting the innerHTML property of an element
To set the value of innerHTML property, you use this syntax: element.innerHTML = newHTML;
The
setting will replace the existing content of an element with the new content. For example, you can remove the entire contents of the document by clearing the contents of the document.body element:
document .body.innerHTML = '' ;
ecurity Risk HTML5 specifies that a <script> tag inserted with innerHTML should not execute. Suppose you have the following index.html document:

<!DOCTYPE html > < html lang = "en" > < head > < meta charset = "UTF-8" > < meta name = "viewport" content = "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" > < title > JS innerHTML example </ title > </ head > < body > < div id = "main" > </ div > < script src = "app.js" > </ script > </ body > </ html >

And the app.js file looks like this: const scriptHTML = `<script>alert("Alert from innerHTML");</script>` ; const main = document .getElementById( 'main' ); main.innerHTML = scriptHTML;
In this example, the alert() inside the <script> tag will not execute. However, if you change the source code of the app.js to the following:
const main = document .getElementById( 'main' ); const externalHTML = `<img src='1' onerror='alert("Error loading image")'>` ; // shows the alert main.innerHTML = externalHTML;
In this example, the image with the src 1 will not be loaded successfully. Therefore, the on error will execute that runs the alert() .
Instead of having a simple alert(), hackers may include malicious code, the users who open the webpage will be vulnerable.
Therefore, you should not set the contents that you have no control to the innerHTML or you will face a potential security risk.
If you want to insert plain text into the document, you can use the textContent property instead of the innerHTML . The textContent will not be parsed as the HTML but as the raw text.
Summary Use innerHTML property of an element to get or set HTML contained within the element. The innerHTML property returns the current HTML source of the element, including any change that has been made since the page was loaded. Do not use innerHTML to set new contents that you have no control to avoid a security risk.
