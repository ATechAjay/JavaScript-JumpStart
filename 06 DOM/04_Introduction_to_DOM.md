Introduction to the DOM

The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web.
What is the DOM?

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.

A web page is a document that can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. In both cases, it is the same document but the Document Object Model (DOM) representation allows it to be manipulated. As an object-oriented representation of the web page, it can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.

For example, the DOM specifies that the querySelectorAll method in this code snippet must return a list of all the <p> elements in the document:
const paragraphs = document.querySelectorAll("p");
// paragraphs[0] is the first <p> element
// paragraphs[1] is the second <p> element, etc.
alert(paragraphs[0].nodeName);
All of the properties, methods, and events available for manipulating and creating web pages are organized into objects. For example, the document object that represents the document itself, any table objects that implement the HTMLTableElement DOM interface for accessing HTML tables, and so forth, are all objects.

The DOM is built using multiple APIs that work together. The core DOM defines the entities describing any document and the objects within it. This is expanded upon as needed by other APIs that add new features and capabilities to the DOM.
DOM and JavaScript

The previous short example, like nearly all examples, is JavaScript. That is to say, it is written in JavaScript, but uses the DOM to access the document and its elements. The DOM is not a programming language, but without it, the JavaScript language wouldn't have any model or notion of web pages, HTML documents, SVG documents, and their component parts. The document as a whole, the head, tables within the document, table headers, text within the table cells, and all other elements in a document are parts of the document object model for that document. They can all be accessed and manipulated using the DOM and a scripting language like JavaScript.
The DOM is not part of the JavaScript language, but is instead a Web API used to build websites. JavaScript can also be used in other contexts. For example, Node.js runs JavaScript programs on a computer, but provides a different set of APIs, and the DOM API is not a core part of the Node.js runtime.

The DOM was designed to be independent of any particular programming language, making the structural representation of the document available from a single, consistent API. Even if most web developers will only use the DOM through JavaScript, implementations of the DOM can be built for any language, as this Python example demonstrates:

# Python DOM example

import xml.dom.minidom as m
doc = m.parse(r"C:\Projects\Py\chap1.xml")
doc.nodeName # DOM property of document object
p_list = doc.getElementsByTagName("para")
Accessing the DOM

You don't have to do anything special to begin using the DOM. You use the API directly in JavaScript from within what is called a script, a program run by a browser.

When you create a script, whether inline in a <script> element or included in the web page, you can immediately begin using the API for the document or window objects to manipulate the document itself, or any of the various elements in the web page (the descendant elements of the document). Your DOM programming may be something as simple as the following example, which displays a message on the console by using the console.log() function:

<body onload="console.log('Welcome to my home page!');">
  â€¦
</body>
 As it is generally not recommended to mix the structure of the page (written in HTML) and manipulation of the DOM (written in JavaScript), the JavaScript parts will be grouped together here, and separated from the HTML.

For example, the following function creates a new h1 element, adds text to that element, and then adds it to the tree for the document:

<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <script>
      // run this function when the document is loaded
      window.onload = () => {
        // create a couple of elements in an otherwise empty HTML page
        const heading = document.createElement("h1");
        const headingText = document.createTextNode("Big Head!");
        heading.appendChild(headingText);
        document.body.appendChild(heading);
      };
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
Fundamental data types

This page tries to describe the various objects and types in simple terms.
Document
When a member returns an object of type document this object is the root document object itself.
Node Every object located within a document is a node of some kind. In an HTML document, an object can be an element node but also a text node or attribute node.
Element
The element type is based on node. It refers to an element or a node of type element returned by a member of the DOM API.
NodeList A nodeList is an array of elements, like the kind that is returned by the method document.querySelectorAll(). Items in a nodeList are accessed by index in either of two ways:

    list.item(1)
    list[1]

These two are equivalent. In the first, item() is the single method on the nodeList object. The latter uses the typical array syntax to fetch the second item in the list.
Attr When an attribute is returned by a member, it is an object reference that exposes a special interface for attributes. Attributes are nodes in the DOM just like elements are, though you may rarely use them as such.

Using the Document Object Model

The Document Object Model (DOM) is an API for manipulating DOM trees of HTML and XML documents (among other tree-like documents). This API is at the root of the description of a page and serves as a base for scripting on the web.
What is a DOM tree?

A DOM tree is a tree structure whose nodes represent an HTML or XML document's contents. Each HTML or XML document has a DOM tree representation. For example, consider the following document:

<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>My Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Header</h1>
    <p>Paragraph</p>
  </body>
</html>
It has a DOM tree that looks like this:

When a web browser parses an HTML document, it builds a DOM tree and then uses it to display the document.
What does the Document API do?

The Document API, also sometimes called the DOM API, allows you to modify a DOM tree in any way you want. It enables you to create any HTML or XML document from scratch or to change any contents of a given HTML or XML document. Web page authors can edit the DOM of a document using JavaScript to access the document property of the global object. This document object implements the Document interface.
