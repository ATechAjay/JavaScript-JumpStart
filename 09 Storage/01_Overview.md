Web Storage API
The Web Storage API provides mechanisms by which browsers can store key/value pairs, in a much more intuitive fashion than using cookies .
Web Storage concepts and usage
The two mechanisms within Web Storage are as follows:
sessionStorage maintains a separate storage area for each given origin that's available for the duration of the page session (as long as the browser is open, including page reloads and restores).
Stores data only for a session, meaning that the data is stored until the browser (or tab) is closed.
Data is never transferred to the server.
Storage limit is larger than a cookie (at most 5MB).
localStorage does the same thing, but persists even when the browser is closed and reopened.
Stores data with no expiration date, and gets cleared only through JavaScript, or clearing the Browser cache / Locally Stored Data.
Storage limit is the maximum amongst the two.
These mechanisms are available via the Window.sessionStorage and Window.localStorage properties
invoking one of these will create an instance of the Storage object, through which data items can be set, retrieved and removed. A different Storage object is used for the sessionStorage and localStorage for each origin â€” they function and are controlled separately.
